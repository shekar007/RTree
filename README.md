# Implementing an R tree using STR method

This code implements an R-Tree data structure using the STR method for creating the R-Tree. The R-Tree is a spatial index structure used for efficient spatial data querying, especially for multidimensional data.

You can do the following
- Insertion
- Search
- Traversal




## Usage

Clone the repo using - 

```
git clone https://github.com/shekar007/RTree.git
```
In the folder with the ```implementation.c```.
run the following - 

```
gcc implementation.c -o implementation -lm
```

You can uncomment the commented insertion code in the ```main``` function of the ```implementation.c```

You can also change ```#define``` to denote the number of points in ```dataBig.txt```
